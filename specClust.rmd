# Background Information

## Similarity Graphs, Adjacency Matrices, and Laplacians

Given a dataset $x_1,...,x_n$ and a measure of similarity $s_{ij}\geq0$ between all pairs of points $x_i$ and $x_j$ in the set, the goal of clustering is to divide observations into groups such that points in the same group are similar, and points in different groups are dissimilar. A good way of representing similarity between observations is through a **similarity graph**, notated as G=(V,E). Each vertex, $v_i\in V$, represents an observationin the dataset. Two vertices are connected by an edge when their similarity $s_{ij}$ exceeds a threshold value. An edge is weighted by $s_{ij}$; the higher the similarity, the higher the weight and vice-versa.

Our clustering problem now is to find a separation of the similarity graph such that edges between different groups have low weights, and edges within the same group have high weights.
